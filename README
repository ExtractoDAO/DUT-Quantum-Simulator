# DUT Quantum Simulator
Studies conducted using the DUT Quantum Simulator can be performed by researchers in a private, secure, and offline computational environment, specifically designed to analyze cosmological structures through non-singular gravitational modeling. Unlike traditional simulation infrastructures, the DUT Quantum simulator is entirely disconnected from external APIs and cloud-based dependencies, ensuring absolute data integrity and researcher autonomy. For the first time in scientific history, researchers worldwide can freely access the source code of the simulator in a transparent, decentralized, and non-custodial fashion. The simulation outputs are not confined to closed review systems; once recorded into the ExtractoDAO Ledger, each result becomes publicly traceable and reproducible. This fundamentally alters the paradigm of peer validation. Rather than relying solely on traditional peer-review panels — often shaped by editorial biases and model adherence (e.g., to the ΛCDM standard) — the DUT Quantum simulator enables community-driven validation. Any independent researcher can replicate the input parameters, observe the simulated outputs, and verify their physical consistency based on data and mathematical coherence alone. ExtractoDAO S.A., through its decentralized governance model, is developing a scientific DAO aimed at building a global peer-network of independent cosmologists and physicists. This system removes the bottleneck imposed by legacy academic journals, enabling a new generation of validation protocols based on mathematical transparency, simulation reproducibility, and cross-referenced observational data. As history shows, even the most foundational cosmological theories — such as the Big Bang, first proposed by Georges Lemaître — began as speculative constructs. It took decades to empirically validate the cosmic microwave background and the expansion of space. ExtractoDAO was created with the philosophical and scientific belief that paradigm shifts demand open, verifiable, and censorship-resistant frameworks, especially in an age when closed academic circles may delay or prevent the acceptance of disruptive cosmological models. By anchoring simulation-based science in an open ledger and DAO governance, the DUT Quantum Simulator redefines scientific authorship: results no longer belong to a gatekeeping institution, but to the verifiable logic of the cosmos itself.
